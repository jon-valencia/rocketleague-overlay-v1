 ws# Jon's Rocket League Overlay v1

Source code for the SOS plugin for BakkesMod can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/bakkesplugins/sos).

To get started, make sure you have BakkesMod and Rocket League both downloaded and setup. Next, open a command prompt in the `sos-ws-relay-master` folder and invoke `npm install` and `node ws-relay.js`, and then press `enter` three times. This will start a WebSocket that will connect to both Rocket League and BakkesMod. 

Next, open Rocket League and BakkesMod, and then load into a 3v3 private match with bots. Then, open the `overlay.html` into a web browser of your choice to verify that everything is running.
